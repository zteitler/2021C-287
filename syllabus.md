## What this course is

Higher mathematics requires a significantly different way of thinking.
There is a much greater focus on the truth, or falsehood,
of statements and connections between facts.
There is much less focus on algorithms (methods for doing problems).

Some students think math is merely a list of procedures--a succession of algorithms
for "how to do" things.
Proof is a major part of mathematics that is not at all like that conception of mathematics.
So, you may need to change your attitude about what math really is.
It is hard for anyone to change their attitude about anything,
so this part may be difficult for you.

This course is an introduction to higher-level, abstract mathematics:
the language of mathematics; logic; definitions;
topics such as sets, functions, relations, convergence, and series;
and especially, proofs.
You will get to practice writing formal mathematics (proofs)
and you will get feedback on your writing.

This will be a challenging course,
and you should expect to spend a lot of time and effort on it;
the ultimate responsibility for what you learn is your own.
I hope you will find that mathematics is broad, rich, interesting, and useful,
and that you can personally be mathematically creative
and have a real feeling of accomplishment from it.
We should also have fun and stretch our brains at the same time,
which is what I think doing mathematics is all about.



## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1.  Explore mathematical definitions and evaluate mathematical statements.

2.  Read and write mathematical proofs at an intermediate level.

3.  Demonstrate content knowledge in areas of mathematics including
    set theory, functions, elementary discrete mathematics, elementary number theory,
    and elementary continuous mathematics.
    Recognize connections between these areas.

4.  Use technologies to support mathematical exploration and communication.

These learning outcomes will support students
in being prepared for upper-division mathematics courses.


## Required Textbook

*The Art of Proof: Basic Training for Deeper Mathematics*
    by Matthias Beck and Ross Geoghegan, 2010,
    <http://math.sfsu.edu/beck/aop.html>

You are required to have this book.
You will need to prepare for class by reading sections from the book before class,
so that you are ready to learn in class.
You will need to have the book available during class, to be able to work on exercises
in groups in class.

You can choose what format of the book will be best for you.
A PDF version of the book is available [from the authors](http://math.sfsu.edu/beck/aop.html)
for free (legally!).
If you want to, you may also order a printed copy of the [published book](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781441970220).

I recommend downloading the free PDF and also buying a printed copy of the book,
if you are able to.
But it is not required.
If you only use the free PDF, that is completely fine.



## Grading

### Components of course grade

Course grades will include participation in class activities, homework,
a midterm exam, and a final exam.

### Class activities

A significant amount of class time will be spent working in groups
on activities from the course textbook,
to practice and learn concepts and skills in the course.


### Homework

Homework will consist of weekly assignments.
These will be individual written assignments so that you can get feedback
on how you are doing in the course.


### Midterm exam

The midterm exam will be an individual written exam.

### Final exam

The final exam will be an individual written exam.


## Preparation and participation

### Preparation

Preparation for class includes reading relevant textbook sections before class,
being ready to learn about that topic in class,
and knowing what questions you are planning to ask
about homework or previous topics.

It's okay if reading the textbook sections before class isn't
enough to understand the material.
The point is to read the section in order to be ready to learn about it in class.
Class discussion of the topic should answer many questions and clarify the reading.
Following class, please re-read the section to fill in details.


### Participation

Constructive participation includes answering or attempting to answer questions in class,
asking good questions, and being respectful of others.

In most weeks, our class plan will be:

Monday:
: I will present material and answer questions.
  I will introduce a new chapter and work some of the problems from the chapter,
  as demonstrations.
  There may be some class activities (group work).

Wednesday:
: I will answer questions.
  Other than that, the class will be almost entirely activities (group work).
  Most of the work will be working more problems from the chapter.

There are some exceptions for review and exams,
and also where some short chapters are combined into a single week to save time.


### Grade

Lack of preparation and participation causes distractions
and degrades the course experience _for other students in the course_.
Therefore failure to meet expectations may result in a penalty
of up to 10% in your overall course grade (at instructor's discretion).
