This homework will be about establishing procedures:
using LaTeX to create a PDF,
and uploading that PDF to [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com);
and using WebWork.

+ For you to practice using LaTeX
+ For you to practice uploading an assignment to Gradescope
+ For me to practice working with a grader in Gradescope


## Problems

+   Read the course syllabus. (You don't need to turn in anything for this.)

1.  


2.  

3.  


5.  (About yourself) Answer the questions. This will not be graded for correctness.
    The goal is just to tell me a little bit about yourself
    (and also to practice using LaTeX's enumerate lists).
    
    ```
    \newpage
    \begin{exer}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item What is your ``official'' name as on the class roster?
    \item What name do you like to go by in class?
    \item How is your name pronounced?
    \item What pronouns do you prefer (this could be she/her/hers, he/him/his,
      they/them/theirs, or other)?
    \item What is something that you are excited to learn in this class?
    \item What is something that you are concerned about in this class?
    \item Is there anything else you would like me to know?
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{exer}
    ```
